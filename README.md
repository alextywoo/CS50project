    # US Area Home Price Search and Trend Visualization
    #### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/iLPXkHaLuEU
    #### Description:
   
    This tool uses the latest US housing data from Zillow to tell users the latest average home price in an area assigned by the users. If the user somehow searched for a less populated area that is not included in the CSV file, the program would parse the input and list city names with available data in that state to remind the user to choose a nearby metro area. Limitation: Only works for US cities following "City, State" format for now due to the dataset selected

    Once the average home price is displayed, the program will prompt user if a visualization of the annual home price for the area is wanted. If answered yes, the program will plot a line chart to show an annual home price trend in the last 24 years (2000 to 2023)
